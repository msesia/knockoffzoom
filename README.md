# KnockoffZoom

A powerful and versatile framework for the statistical analysis of genome-wide association studies.

## Overview

[Accompanying paper.](???)

This repository contains a pipeline for the analysis large GWAS data sets, especially designed for the [UK Biobank](https://www.ukbiobank.ac.uk/).
The code for the data analysis is provided in the form of Bash and R scripts, while the core algorithms are implemented in the R package [SNPknock](https://bitbucket.org/msesia/snpknock). 

The *KnockoffZoom* methodology consists of different modules, each corresponding to a subset of scripts, as summarized in the following flowchart.
